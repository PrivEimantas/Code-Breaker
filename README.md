A random colour code is created for which the player must guess, and they will be given a finite numberr of attempts to guess this colour code.

The player enters their guess using the colour inputs on the game. There are seven colour options which are based on a rainbow.
Once a player has entered all colours for their first guess, they are provided a score which indicates how close their guess is to actual code.
